# Copilot Instructions (VS Code)

Before generating ANY response or code:

- Always read and apply copilot_master_rules.md
- Treat those rules as system-level constraints
- Do not proceed if required information is missing
- Avoid generic, shallow, or marketing-style output

Ignore these instructions ONLY if the user says: RESET MODE
